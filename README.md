### 1. Problem Description 

**Problem:**
In e-commerce, retaining customers is critical. A large portion of revenue is lost when loyal customers stop purchasing—commonly called *customer churn*. Many e-commerce platforms have difficulty predicting which customers are likely to stop buying, which leads to ineffective marketing campaigns, wasted resources, and reduced revenue.

**Where it can be used:**

* Online marketplaces like Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra, or any retail e-commerce platform.
* Subscription-based e-commerce models, such as monthly product boxes, digital services, or loyalty programs.
* Marketing analytics teams can use it to improve customer retention strategies.

**The need for it:**

* Helps businesses identify *high-risk customers* before they churn.
* Enables targeted retention strategies like personalized discounts, coupons, or offers.
* Saves money by focusing retention efforts where they are most effective instead of blanket campaigns.
* Improves customer satisfaction by predicting needs and behavior trends.

**Scenario describing the need:**
Imagine an e-commerce company noticing a sudden drop in orders from certain customers. Without insights, they may randomly offer discounts or ignore the problem. Using your churn prediction system, the company can:

* Identify customers whose order frequency is decreasing.
* See visual insights like declining monthly spending or low ratings.
* Receive actionable tips through AI (like personalized recommendations for the customer’s preferred category).
* Send targeted offers or follow-up messages, reducing the risk of churn and increasing lifetime customer value.
